# Anytime Non-Parametric A* for PR2 Navigation with Pybullet

## Overview

This project implements the Anytime Non-Parametric A* (ANA*) algorithm for PR2 robot navigation through multiple scenes using the Pybullet physics simulation library. ANA* is a path planning algorithm that combines the advantages of A* with anytime computation, making it suitable for real-time robot navigation in dynamic environments.

In this README, we provide an overview of the project, installation instructions, and an example of how to use ANPPA* for PR2 navigation in Pybullet.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the required environment:
